DAY 3

vim:

To start Vim Commands, type VIM in terminal:

Press scape to access the comand then here are the commands=>>
=>:q! to exit
=>:wq! to save and exit
=>:i to insert
=>:o to insert too. Not sure about this one.

To open a file, go to the file folder and type:
Vim "filename.html"
press scape to do some commands like: 
=> : Set Ruler - to see where the line is
=> :syntax on - to color the commands:
=> : set laststatus=2
=> :set number

$ vim .vimrc to do all that to all document by default, otherwise it is raw everytime it opens. What I mean with this is that it is just black and white.

Cap L and M moves the cursor.
Shift {} to move up and down faster.

if you go, let's say, to a text inside parenthesis, you type c - i and "" selects all and you could type.
Capital Q to insert tag at the beginning and Capital A to go to the end of the line.
the dot (.) repeats the previous entry.

=> press q to record macro all keys when pressed.

=>Capital V to select all.
